
To cross compile follow the instructions at
https://wiki.onion.io/Tutorials/Cross-Compile

Extract the Thingworx C SDK and add the code in this directory to the same folders structure.
You'll need to edit the Makefile.mips-openwrt-linux-uclibc to set the root directory

to build in linux change the directory as follows and run make
cd code/examples/sensor/linux
make PLATFORM=mips-openwrt-linux-uclibc BUILD=release

The included binaries were compiled with the c-sdk-1.3.1.957-release version of the Thingworx C SDK.

To compile a version with TLS (secure sockets) support swap the following comments out in src/porting/twLinux.h of the Thingworx C SDK files.

#define NO_TLS
//#define TW_TLS_INCLUDE "twAxTls.h" 
#define TW_TLS_INCLUDE "twNoTls.h"
